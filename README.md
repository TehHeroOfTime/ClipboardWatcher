# ClipboardWatcher
Watches your clipboard and gives the option to save all images, text and filenames automatically or manually.

ClipboardWatcher will display all copied images,text, and names of files in its GUI. ClipboardWatcher gives the option to manually save these, or save them whenever ClipboardWatcher exits. This includes windows shutdown. If you have selected automatic saving you can choose to not interact with ClipboardWatcher for a certain time and look back upon what you copied in given time.

I have created this application purely for myself because i like programming it, and i think it's funny to look back on what images,files or text i copied a long time ago.

(V2.6.0) Change the resolution of ClipboardWatcher by pressing Esc!
